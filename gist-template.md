## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are special characters in regular expressions (regex) that match a position in the string being searched, rather than a character. There are two types of anchors: start and end.

Start Anchor (^): Matches the position at the start of the string. For example, ^A matches an A only if it appears at the beginning of the string.

End Anchor ($): Matches the position at the end of the string. For example, A$ matches an A only if it appears at the end of the string.

Anchors are useful for ensuring that the match occurs in a specific location within the string. For example, if you only want to match a pattern if it appears at the start of a line, you can use the start anchor ^ in combination with the multiline flag m in your regex.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are special characters in regular expressions (regex) that specify the number of times a character or group of characters can occur. There are several types of quantifiers:

? - Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group. For example, A? matches an optional A.

- - Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, A+ matches one or more As.

* - Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, A\* matches zero or more As.

{n} - Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, A{3} matches exactly three As.

{n,} - Matches n or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, A{3,} matches three or more As.

{m,n} - Matches at least m and at most n occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, A{2,5} matches two to five As.

Quantifiers are useful for specifying the number of times a character or group of characters can occur in a string, allowing you to make complex matches with a single pattern.
